# Restore the BacAtlas database from `/restore/bacatlas.dump`, or start empty if there is none.
#
# Run by the official postgres image's entrypoint, and ⚠ ONLY on the first start against an EMPTY
# data volume — that is the image's rule, not ours. A new dump is therefore never picked up by a
# restart: the drill is `docker compose down -v` (drops the volume) and `docker compose up -d`.
#
# ⛔ If this script fails, the image has ALREADY run `initdb`, so the volume is no longer empty: the
# container restarts (`restart: unless-stopped`), SKIPS this script, and comes up healthy on whatever
# half-restored state it left — measured with a truncated dump: healthy within a second, 0 tables.
# So a failure leaves a marker in the data directory, and the compose healthcheck refuses to report
# healthy while it exists — the api never starts, and `up --wait` fails instead of serving an empty
# catalogue. The only way out is the right one: `docker compose down -v`, fix the dump, `up` again.
#
# ⚠ Keep this file EXECUTABLE. The entrypoint runs an executable `.sh` in its own process but SOURCES
# a non-executable one into the entrypoint's shell, where `set -u` and any early exit would leak.
