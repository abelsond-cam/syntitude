"""`/api/v1/species…` — the catalogue, one locus, its arrangements, its function tab, and search.

⭐ **Every response is immutable for a build**, because writes are ours alone and offline. So each
carries `ETag: "{pangenome_id}"` and a long `Cache-Control`, and the cache is a pure function of its
key with nothing that can invalidate it — the single largest payoff of the read-only scope.

⛔ **`locus_label` is the only locus identifier that appears in a URL.** It is the existing page's
hash, so every link a reader has saved keeps working, and it is durable across a re-export while the
surrogate id and the catalogue ordinal are not. The integer id appears only inside responses.

⚠ **A failed request and an empty result must never render the same.** The rule generalises from
`app.js:4604` — *"a sequence panel that fails silently is one a reader will read as 'this genome has
nothing here', which is a different claim and a false one"* — so a 404 says which of the species, the
pangenome or the locus was missing, and never returns an empty body with a 200.
