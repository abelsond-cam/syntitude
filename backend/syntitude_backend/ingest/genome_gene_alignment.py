"""Reproduce the extractor's gene order, and PROVE it against the parquet before writing a row.

⛔ **`flat_index` is a running counter over the CDS the extractor KEPT, and it cannot be inferred
from coordinates.** Every embedding matrix, every `{BS}_*.parquet` and every assignment file is
keyed on it. Admit or drop one CDS the extractor did not and every index after it names a different
gene — which puts one gene's sequence, product, UniRef50 family and locus membership under another
gene's name, with nothing on any page looking wrong.

Measured on 25 probe genomes: the GFFs carry **6–18 more CDS lines than their meta parquets**
(mean 11.2). So the two cannot be zipped, and the filter chain has to be reproduced:

1. drop a `pseudo` CDS  ── in the parser
2. drop a CDS whose contig is absent from the `##FASTA` block
3. drop one whose translation is empty
4. drop one carrying an internal stop
5. bucket what survives by seqid **in encounter order**, then concatenate the buckets

⛔ Step 5 is why the contig order is an enumeration and not a vote. The first version of nuna's own
build inferred it from `bakta_products.contig_map`'s modal coordinate vote and **failed the gate on
27 of 100 E. coli genomes**: that vote keeps only `(start, end)` pairs unique within a genome, so a
short contig whose only CDS shares coordinates with another gets no vote and cannot be named at all.
Enumeration has no such hole — every kept CDS names its own contig, so the map is total.

⭐ **And none of that is trusted.** `check_against_meta` re-derives the answer from the parquet on
four independent things at once — gene count, contig index, coordinates, and the protein string —
and refuses the genome on any disagreement. A misaligned flatten is exactly the failure a downstream
test cannot see, so it is caught here or not at all.
