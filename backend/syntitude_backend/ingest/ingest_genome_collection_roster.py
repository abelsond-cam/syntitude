"""The roster a pangenome was built over — `genome_collection` and its ordinals.

⭐ **The ordinal is the whole point of this table.** `meta.genomes` is the genome VOCABULARY that
`arr.gid` indexes into, and it is `sorted(universe["sample_id"].unique())` — `export_payload.main`'s
own line. Every arrangement's membership is a list of positions in that list, so getting the order
wrong renames every genome on the page and nothing downstream can detect it.

⛔ **Stored, never re-derived by sorting at read time.** It is a contract with payloads that are
already published, and re-deriving an ordering that was once written down is exactly the implicit
ordering this project punishes. A locale-sensitive sort, a different pandas version's `unique()`
order, or a roster that later grows by one genome would each silently renumber it.

⚠ **N comes from the roster, not from the rows present.** `genome_count` is the prevalence
denominator *and* the exclusivity denominator, and `profile_from_pairs`' rule is that a genome
contributing no gene to a locus still counts against it. So it is `len(samples)` — which
`build_payload` itself refuses to let disagree with `n_genomes`.
