"""Where every input of one catalogue lives — resolved once, checked all at once.

⛔ **This is derived from the naming conventions, NOT from `meta.audit.sources`.** That key
under-reports: the published *E. coli* payload names two artifacts (`_pfam_concordance.tsv` and
`_audit_summary.json`) while the export read **three** — the homology waterfall CSV supplied the
collapse tier, the resolved threshold and the ESM distance pair, and is never listed. A locator
built from it would silently omit the file three columns come from.

⛔ **Every missing artifact is reported together, and named.** One `FileNotFoundError` per run means
finding a second gap costs a second run; at eight artifact families and two representations that is
how a load takes an afternoon. `MissingArtifacts` lists all of them, with what each would have
supplied, so one look is enough.

⚠ **Three filename traps, all of them measured on the real store:**

1. **The output filename doubles the set token.** `locus_browser_{set}_{label}.json`, and `{label}`
   itself begins with the set — `locus_browser_ecoli_ecoli_nuna4_g2_0.98_…json`. A locator that
   assumes one `ecoli` finds nothing.
2. **A run's siblings are DERIVED, not passed.** `export_payload._nearest_sibling` finds the nearest
   -loci CSV by string-replacing `_cluster_similarity_` in the similarity CSV's own path, so it is
   addressed relative to it rather than rebuilt from the label. Reproduced here for the same reason:
   one run's medians can then never be paired with another run's neighbour list, which is a
   mismatch nothing downstream could detect — both would be in range and plausible. (The retired
   neighbourhood map addressed its two siblings the same way.)
3. **The payload JSON is not under `analysis/`.** The exporter writes it beside the maps on CSD3,
   but the local pull lands it in `data/browser/`. It is an ORACLE here, never an input.
