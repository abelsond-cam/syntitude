"""One locus, whole — the hot path, and the fan-out it exists to fix.

⭐ **Rendering one locus touches a median 15–19 other loci and up to 303**, because a neighbour's
*name* is a transitive read through its Pfam and product lists. `display_name` and `best_product` are
materialised at ingest, so that read becomes `WHERE locus_id = ANY($1)` over ~20 ids: **one index
scan, in the same round trip**, carried as `neighbour_display_rows`.

⛔ **The statement count must not grow with the neighbour count.** That is the property worth
asserting, and it is what a naive implementation breaks: fetching each neighbour's name on demand is
15–19 round trips typically and 303 at worst, every one of them correct. A per-request budget of "4"
would be a number to satisfy rather than a property to hold — this module issues **one statement per
table the response draws from**, and the cost oracle asserts that against the tables, not a snapshot.

⛔ **`occ(code)` is deleted.** A slot is `null` plus an explicit `absence_reason`, never a bare `-1`:
that packed form is exactly where the "−1 means five different things" trap lives.

⚠ **The four remainders stay four.** `observed − listed` is a *display* cut; `size − observed` is
*missing data* (contig ends); `total − listed` is arrangements not drawn; `size − listed` is members
with no recorded neighbourhood. A rewrite that computes "the rest" once collapses them, and the page
starts making a claim it cannot support.
