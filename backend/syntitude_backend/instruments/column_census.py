"""What every column actually HOLDS, measured — so a claim can be checked against its contents.

⛔ **This exists because the defects this project keeps producing are not bugs.** They are mismatches
between what a column *means* and what it *holds*, and no assertion knows the difference: `cog_cat`
held `CP` in a column that fits it, `bakta_gene_symbol` lost 125 of 1,180,647 symbols, a Pfam
architecture was truncated at 256 characters into a valid-looking different architecture. Every one
passed every test, because every test compared a value to a value.

⭐ **So measure the contents and put them beside the declaration.** A `String(16)` whose longest
value is 4 characters is fine; one whose longest is 16 is one genome away from silent truncation. A
column documented as a scalar whose values contain a separator is a set. A `measurement()` column
with no NULLs has either never been absent or is being filled with a zero. None of those is decidable
from the code alone, and all three are obvious from a census.

⚠ **A census FLAGS; it does not judge.** Every row it emits is a question, and the answer is in the
column's docstring or in the artifact it was read from. A finding is only a finding once it has been
verified against Postgres or the real files — which is the rule the pass this serves runs under.
