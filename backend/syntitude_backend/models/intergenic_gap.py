"""Intergenic regions — a property of an ADJACENCY, not of a position.

⛔ Keyed on the **canonical pair** of flanking loci, which is what makes the whole block additive:
nothing is inserted into any sequence, so the offsets, the marginal and the joint views are all
untouched. Canonical, because the track is drawn in the focal gene's reading frame and a
neighbourhood may be mirrored — an orientation-dependent key would miss on half of them.

⛔⛔ **THE CANONICAL ORDER IS BY `node_label`, WHICH IS TEXT — NOT BY ANY INTEGER.**
`intergenic.gene_adjacencies` sorts the pair with ``left <= right`` on the **node ids**
(`intergenic.py:106-118`), and node ids are text. Everything downstream inherits that ordering.

This is not a stylistic choice, and getting it wrong has already cost the live site. The published
page keys its gap lookup by payload INDEX —
``GAPAT[(x < y ? x : y) + "|" + (x < y ? y : x)]`` (`app.js:75`) — against a map built from the
label-sorted pairs the exporter shipped. Measured on the two published catalogues:

    ecoli  22,838 gaps · 7,379 (32.3 %) have a > b by index · 100 % are label-sorted
    kp     20,544 gaps · 6,108 (29.7 %) have a > b by index · 100 % are label-sorted

Those 7,379 and 6,108 gaps **cannot be found by the page**: it asks for ``"890|3819"`` and the map
holds ``"3819|890"``. `gapBetween` returns null, `gapSlot` returns null, and the track simply draws
no intergenic block — which renders as *"these two genes are adjacent with nothing between them"*,
a claim the data does not make. It is the exact failure mode this codebase names elsewhere: an
absence that reads as a measurement.

So the columns below are named `a`/`b` and **not** `low`/`high`, because there is no numeric
ordering to appeal to, and a `CHECK (low <= high)` on surrogate ids would silently impose a second,
different canonicalisation on top of the real one. The ordering invariant is asserted at ingest
against the labels, and the API resolves a pair by sorting its two labels before it queries.

⚠ **Three things this is not.** A gap is not a locus — no cluster, no embedding, not in the locus
count, not walkable. Its length is a **median over genomes that disagree**, not a distance. And the
page draws gaps only where an arrangement is selected: without one the track shows each position's
marginal mode, and two marginal modes need not be neighbours in any genome, so the space between
them is not an observed gap.
