"""ORM rows → plain dicts. **No ORM object escapes a serialiser.**

⛔ **A slot is `null` plus an `absence_reason`, never a bare `-1`.** `occ(code)` is deleted: that
packed form is exactly where the "−1 means five different things" trap lives, and a serialiser that
mapped every `-1` to `null` would be right twice and destroy three meanings.

⛔ **Every remainder is its own named field, one per sentence.** `observed_not_listed` is a
*display* cut; `members_without_an_observation` is *missing data* (a contig end);
`arrangements_not_listed` is what the arrangement cap left out; `members_in_arrangements_not_listed`
is the members inside those; `members_without_a_neighbourhood` is members with no recorded window at
all. A rewrite that computes "the rest" once collapses them and the page starts making a claim it
cannot support — so each is emitted, and each is emitted even when it is zero.

⚠ **There are five here and four in the plan, and the fifth is the API's own doing.** The published
payload is uncapped, so *members past the cap* did not exist as a category and `size − Σ(listed)`
really did mean "no coordinates for the gene, so no window". The moment the API capped the
arrangement list that stopped being true, and splitting the two is what keeps the fourth honest.

⚠ **`null` is *not measured* and `0.0` is *measured zero*, everywhere below.** A serialiser that
emitted `0` for an absent float would turn "we did not look" into "we looked and found nothing".
