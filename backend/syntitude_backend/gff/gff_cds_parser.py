"""One pass over a Bakta GFF → its CDS features and its contig sequences.

⛔ **One pass, not two.** The CDS lines and the ``##FASTA`` block are in the same file, and a
1.9 MB gzipped GFF costs more to decompress twice than to hold once. The reader therefore returns
both halves together and the caller decides what to keep.

⛔ **No pandas.** ``extract_strand.parse_gff_cds`` returns a DataFrame, which is right for an
ingest job and wrong here: pandas is in the backend's ``ingest`` extra, not its serving
dependencies, and the sequence endpoint runs on a machine that has neither pandas nor ``nuna``.

Coordinates are the GFF's own: **1-based inclusive**, and ``end`` includes the stop codon.
