"""The JOINT ±5 view — whole neighbourhoods that some set of genomes actually has.

⛔ **Not the same thing as `locus_offset_occupant`, and not per gene.** An arrangement is a complete
ten-slot vector carried together. The marginal view reduces each offset independently, and where a
locus occurs in more than one arrangement *"the marginal describes none of them, and read
left-to-right it is a gene order nothing has."* The page draws the TRACK from here and the BAR under
each block from there. The per-gene link is `gene_locus_membership.locus_arrangement_id`.
