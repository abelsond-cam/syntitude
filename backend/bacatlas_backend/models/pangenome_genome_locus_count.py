"""How many loci each genome carries in one pangenome — the anchor dropdown's number, stored.

⭐ **Precomputed at ingest, never aggregated per request.** The published page derived this on first
opening of the anchor box (`app.js::genomeCounts`) by one pass over the ~490k-entry membership index it
already held. A server holds no such index in memory; the equivalent query is an aggregation over
`gene_locus_membership`, which is **~412 M rows per pangenome at the 80,000-genome design target**, on
every keystroke in a picker. So it is written once, by the pangenome layer, in the same transaction as
the rows it counts.

    """One genome of a pangenome's collection, and the two different numbers of loci it is in.

    ⛔ **Two counts, named apart, because they are different facts and only one is the page's.**

    * `locus_count` — distinct loci where the genome has **at least one gene** (`gene_locus_membership`).
    * `arrangement_locus_count` — distinct loci where the genome sits in **some arrangement's**
      `member_genome_ids`. This is exactly `app.js::genomeCounts`, which is what the dropdown printed.

    They differ wherever a genome's gene reached no ±5 window — `coords` is an inner join in the export,
    so a gene alone on its contig is counted present at its locus and appears in no arrangement. That is
    the same gap that makes 6.26 % of ecoli loci "incomplete" (`locus.arrangement_member_genome_count`),
    seen from the genome side instead of the locus side, and it touches **every** probe genome.

    ⛔ **Both are `COUNT(DISTINCT locus)`, never `COUNT(*)`.** A genome at ρ > 1 has two genes at one
    locus and can sit in two arrangements there; counting rows instead of loci returns a plausible,
    slightly-too-large number — per-genome gene totals, not locus totals — that nothing on the page
    could contradict.

    ⚠ Every member of the pangenome's collection has a row, including one that contributed no gene at
    all (both counts 0). The dropdown lists every genome it can anchor; a missing row would drop a genome
    from the picker rather than say it is in nothing. `publish_pangenome` refuses a catalogue without one
    row per collection genome.
