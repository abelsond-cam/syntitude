"""A genome the model never clustered, placed on a published pangenome's loci.

⛔ **This layer only ever ADDS.** A projected genome is not a member of the collection, contributes no
gene to `gene_locus_membership`, and changes no count anywhere else: prevalence, bands, the census,
the marginals, arrangement genome counts and the genome picker all stay the modelled 100. Two tables,
written by `--stage projection`, and nothing else in the schema is touched — which is what keeps the
publish gate, the column audit and the parity suites meaningful while this feature exists.

⛔ **A placement is not what the model would have done.** The model is a CPM chain (ESM step 2 →
Bacformer 3b → step 4); this is one nearest-neighbour hop in Bacformer space. `rule_label` carries that
sentence into the database so no reader of these rows has to be told separately, and the API and the
page repeat it. Method and limitations: nuna `docs/locus_projection.md`.

⚠ **There is no novelty status** (David, 2026-09-22). Every gene is placed, `locus_id` is NOT NULL, and
a distant placement is visible through `nearest_cosine` and the agreement rather than hidden behind a
threshold. A schema with a nullable locus would invite one.
