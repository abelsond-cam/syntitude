"""Set-to-set embedding similarity: the per-locus numbers, the five nearest, and the baseline.

⛔ **What this replaced, and why it is a different measurement rather than a renaming.**
``locus.{esm,bacformer}_{within,nearest}_medoid_distance`` measured a locus by reducing it to ONE
member — the gene with the highest cosine to its centroid — and then measuring that single point:
``within`` was its members' distance to that gene, ``nearest`` that gene's distance to another
locus's medoid. ``bac80_marker_tokens.md`` §4.4 measured that construction inverting the
inter/intra ordering; on the probe catalogue it did not invert but is biased optimistic — the
all-pairs median sits 0.009–0.017 below the medoid one and separation < 0 was understated at 2.5 %
against the true 4.2 % (rank agreement ρ 0.936–0.988, so the *ordering* was largely right).

Everything here is measured over the whole **set**, or anchored on a **point**. The three views the
card offers are NOT three pictures of one thing: flagging by each — worst decile of separation,
negative weak margin, own fraction below 1 — only **34 %** (ecoli/bacformer) and **18 %** (esm) of
flagged loci are flagged by all three, and of the median's worst decile only 50 % / 22 % have a
negative margin. Rank ρ 0.79–0.93: they agree overall and part at the tail, which is where flagging
happens. That measurement is why all three are stored rather than one being chosen.

⛔ **Every name here is kept under the length that makes a constraint name TRUNCATE.** Postgres caps an
identifier at 63 characters; past that SQLAlchemy substitutes a 4-hex hash, so the database gets a name
nobody wrote — and Alembic's autogenerate compares check constraints against the name that was *asked* for,
so such a table reports as drifted from its own migration **forever**, with no fix short of renaming. The
binding constraint is ``ck_{table}__{column}_is_not_nan``: with this table's name that leaves 31 characters
for a column, and the longest here uses 22.

⚠ **``weakest → own`` implies the own fraction by ARITHMETIC**: if the weakest member's nearest gene
is a stranger then the fraction cannot be 1. Those two agreeing is never evidence of anything.
