"""Flip a species onto a pangenome — the one-row update that decides what the service serves.

⭐ **This is what makes a re-ingest safe on a running service.** Ingest builds a whole generation
alongside the live one and never touches the pointer; this flips it, in its own transaction, once the
new catalogue is complete. A rollback is the same update backwards, which is why the old generation
is dropped only after the new one has served.

⛔ **It VERIFIES before it flips, and the verification is not a formality.** Publishing an incomplete
catalogue is the one failure this design can produce that a reader cannot see: every page renders,
every number is in range, and a block is simply missing. The checks below are each a thing that has
either gone wrong before or would be invisible if it did — a locus count that disagrees with the
row count, a landing locus that was never written (the render-time mutation that shipped five days
of pages opening on locus 0), a species whose loci belong to a different species, a geometry that
covers one representation and not both.

⚠ **`--force` exists and says what it is.** A catalogue can be published with a known gap — the local
mirror has no gate ledger, for instance — but the gap is named in the return value rather than
silently tolerated.
