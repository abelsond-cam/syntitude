"""The two orderings the page reads and never computes — separation percentiles, and interest.

Both were single implementations already: `sepIndex` in `app.js`, `_interest`/`ranking` in
`render_page`. Moving them to ingest keeps them single and makes the landing locus a column behind a
verification gate rather than a render-time payload mutation — the mutation that shipped five days
of pages opening on locus 0.

⛔ **The percentile is a MIDRANK over MEASURABLE loci only — not over the catalogue.** The card
prints *"p12 of 12,104 loci"* and both halves of that sentence are assertions. Singletons have no
separation and must read *not measurable*, never `0.000`.

⚠ **Gate measurability on the GEOMETRY, never on the prevalence band.** On the published *E. coli*
catalogue the unmeasurable set is exactly the 5,427 loci of size 1, while `prevalence_band = RARE`
covers **5,458** — the extra 31 are paralogues inside one genome, which do have a measurable
separation. Gating on the band would blank 31 real measurements and nothing would say so.

⛔ **`interest_score` must be computed on the payload's ROUNDED values, not on full precision.**
`a5` ships at 4 decimal places and `resolved` at 3, and the score weights them `3e5` and `2e6`; a
difference in the fifth decimal of `a5` moves the score by 30, which is enough to swap two neighbours
in a ranking whose top four become the published example chips. Reproducing the ranking means
reproducing the rounding.

⚠ **Two things about `interest_score`'s sign, both of which read wrong at a glance.** `-1e12` is a
**sentinel** and not a score — 51 *E. coli* loci carry it, barred outright because a disjoint Pfam
architecture is evidence *against* the merge. And `(major − 1) × 2e6` makes **942** more loci
legitimately negative without being barred at all, so *"negative means barred"* is false.
