"""The catalogues the live pages serve — the `(species, model_label, run_id)` triples, checked in.

⛔ **The run_id is NOT the model label with the species swapped, and guessing it fails silently in
the worst way: it resolves.** The two published runs are

    ecoli   …_preclusterstrict98pm3b-3b0.5-excl_…
    kp      …_preclusterkp98pm3b-3b0.5-excl_…

`strict98` against `kp98`. Substituting `kp` for `ecoli` in the *E. coli* run_id yields a path that
does not exist — which is the lucky case. A run_id that differs only in a **default-emitted token**
would resolve to a different run's assignment and load a whole catalogue that is wrong about which
model produced it, because *"run ids emit tokens non-default-only"*: two models differing only in a
ρ rule have produced byte-identical provenance.

So the triples live here, in the repo, rather than being reconstructed by a rule. `meta.model_id` in
a published payload is the only other place they are written down, and that is an output.

⚠ Both are **`nuna4` on the superseded DAMPED weight** — the `-excl` token, decoded by
`exclusivity.form_from_run_id`, is `damped_exclusion`. `-excl` is a *prefix* of `-exclLOGP`, so
never test it with `in` / `endswith` / `.replace`.

⛔ **`nuna5` is deliberately ABSENT, and that absence is the decision — not an omission to be fixed.**
This file names what the STATIC site serves, and the static site is `nuna4` only (David, 2026-09-25):
it is the parity oracle and the rollback, so it must not move when the service does. `nuna5` is
ingested into the database and reached through the service, which holds every catalogue and lets the
display pick one; it has no static page and no shipped payload for these triples to reconcile against.
Adding a row here would assert a publication that does not exist.

⚠ So this file and `pangenome.is_published` now mean **different things**, on purpose: `is_published`
is picker visibility inside the service (four catalogues are visible), while a row here is a page on
GitHub Pages (two). The day a nuna5 catalogue is published statically it gains a row and its own
`dset` — which is why that key is carried explicitly rather than derived from the species.

⛔ **Three keys, three jobs, and conflating any two of them has already cost a debugging session:**

    pathogen_species.species_key    ecoli          the organism
    PublishedCatalogue.dset         ecoli          the static page (`ecoli.html`), = `--dset`
    pangenome.catalogue_key         ecoli-nuna4    the service's address, what the picker sends

`dset` and `catalogue_key` differ for nuna4 and always will: the service reads the hyphen to tell
"pin this catalogue" from "follow this species' default", so it cannot spell nuna4 as `ecoli`; and
`ecoli.html` is a published url, so the static site cannot spell it `ecoli-nuna4`.
