"""Bulk loading — ``COPY``, and the value coercions that must happen at the boundary.

⛔ **``COPY``, never ``executemany``, and never the ORM.** 1.02 M gene rows at 100 genomes becomes
412 M at 80,000, and the difference between the three is two orders of magnitude, not a constant
factor. The ORM path also builds a Python object per row, which is where an ingest quietly acquires
a memory ceiling.

⚠ **Text-format COPY, deliberately, for now.** Binary is roughly 2–3× faster but requires the
column type OIDs to be resolved and pinned per table — including the eleven user-defined enum types
— which is a plumbing surface that fails silently by writing a plausible wrong value. Text format
lets Postgres parse each field into the column's own type, so an enum, an array and a JSONB column
all arrive correctly with no type table to keep in step. Measured cost is what should change this,
not preference: if a rung of the scale ladder shows the load is COPY-bound, add a binary path
*behind this same function* and cross-check the two on one table.

⛔ **NaN is coerced here, at the boundary.** Every ``measurement()`` column has a CHECK forbidding
NaN, and the CHECK is the backstop — this is the intent. Postgres defines ``NaN = NaN`` as TRUE, so
a NaN that got in would compare equal to itself and be indistinguishable from a real value in every
later query.

      the CHECK constraints were written against that (``exclusivity_form = 'EXCLUSION'``). Passing
      ``.value`` writes ``'exclusion'``, which the enum type rejects — loudly, fortunately.
    - **A numpy scalar → its Python equivalent.** ``numpy.int64`` has no text dumper registered, and
      the failure is an adaptation error a long way from the column that caused it.
