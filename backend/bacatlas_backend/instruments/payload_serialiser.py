"""Rebuild the published locus-browser payload from the database.

⭐⭐ **This is an instrument, not an endpoint.** The API serves its own, better shape — nulls with a
named ``absence_reason``, a resolved 6×6 cosine matrix, four separately named remainders. This
module exists to prove a different claim: that the database is a **lossless superset** of the JSON
catalogue the static site ships, checked against the real 17,531-locus payload rather than asserted.
Once that holds, the static site can be retired knowing nothing on it was lost.

⛔⛔ **EMISSION ORDER IS THE WHOLE PROBLEM.** ``_Intern`` assigns a string its index *on first use*,
so the pools in ``strings`` are in whatever order ``build_payload`` walked the data. Emit the same
strings in a different order and the payload is **correct and not identical** — every ``idx`` column
differs and a column-wise diff reports the catalogue changed. The order is therefore not a detail of
this file, it is its contract:

1. ``nodes`` first, **column by column in payload order**, because its dict literal is what interns
   ``name`` → ``tier`` → ``pfclass`` → ``cog_cat`` → ``go_0/1/2``;
2. then the ``lists`` loop, in ``build_payload``'s own order: sym, prod, u50, pfam, cog, ec, kegg, go;
3. then the ``u50`` **second pass**, which adds to ``prod``, ``pfam`` and ``sym`` — three pools that
   already have entries.

⭐ **The order is checked, not trusted.** :func:`build_payload_from_database` runs
:func:`verify_intern_walk` over its own output before returning, so a wrong emission order raises
here — with the pool and the column named — instead of surfacing later as thousands of changed
indices in a diff nobody can read.

⚠ **Every value is READ, never recomputed.** The ingest wrote the float columns through the
payload's own ``_floats``/``_sigfigs`` helpers, so ``locus.syntenic_a5`` already *is* ``nodes.a5``.
Re-rounding a stored value would risk double rounding; re-deriving one would risk disagreeing with
the report, which is the mistake ``pfam_concordance_class`` exists to prevent.
