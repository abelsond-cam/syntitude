"""The migration must build the models exactly, and must be reversible AND re-appliable.

⛔ Three properties, and each was broken on the first attempt — none of which reading the generated
file would have shown:

1. Autogenerate **omitted the circular foreign key** `pathogen_species.published_pangenome_id →
   pangenome`. It can only be created by ALTER after both tables exist, and Alembic dropped that
   edge on the floor. The column is the publish-flip pointer, so without the constraint nothing
   stops it naming a pangenome that does not exist.
2. `downgrade` dropped the tables but **not the eleven ENUM types**, so `downgrade` → `upgrade`
   died on `CREATE TYPE ... already exists`. A migration that cannot be re-applied is not
   reversible.
3. Nothing checks that the migration still matches the models unless something asks — so
   `test_no_drift` does.
