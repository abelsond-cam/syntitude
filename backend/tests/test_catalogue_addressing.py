"""Two catalogues of one species, held at once and addressed apart.

⭐ **What this protects.** A species may now hold several catalogues — nuna4 beside nuna5, or a
sensitive model beside a less-sensitive one — and the *display* picks which to show (David,
2026-09-25). The storage layer always allowed it; what is new is that a reader can address one.

The failure modes these cover, each of which renders perfectly while being wrong:

**A key that steals another key's payloads.** nuna's payload lookup globs `locus_browser_<key>_*`
and takes the newest match, so `ecoli` would also match `locus_browser_ecoli_nuna5_*.json` and, being
the later export, win — the live page then serves a different model's catalogue in silence. A hyphen
cannot occur inside a species token, so `ecoli-nuna5` is safe where `ecoli_nuna5` is not. Same shape
as `-excl` being a prefix of `-exclLOGP`.

**A resolver that follows the default when it was asked to pin.** A link carrying `ecoli-nuna5` must
keep meaning that clustering after the default moves; that is the entire reason the model is in the
URL. If `resolve_catalogue` ever fell back to the species' default, every shared link would silently
start showing whatever is current, and two people discussing one locus would be looking at different
clusterings while seeing the same URL.

**A second catalogue reaching into the first's rows.** Node labels and ordinals are model-private, so
loading nuna5 must leave nuna4's loci exactly as they were.
