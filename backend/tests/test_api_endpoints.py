"""The API against the loaded catalogue — what it returns, and what it COSTS.

⭐ **The cost assertion is the point of this file, and it is a property rather than a number.** The
N+1 bug is invisible to every correctness test: a locus response is byte-identical whether its twenty
neighbours arrive in one indexed fetch or in twenty round trips. So the assertion is *"the statement
count does not grow with the neighbour count"*, checked by driving the locus with the FEWEST resolved
neighbours and the one with the MOST and requiring the same count — which is scale-free, and which a
recorded budget of "11" would not be.

⚠ These run against `SYNTITUDE_DATABASE_URL` with the published catalogues loaded and PUBLISHED. A
loaded-but-unpublished pangenome serves nothing, so the fixture says which of the two is missing
rather than skipping on a bare `None`.
