/**
 * The small numbers on the locus card that are *computed* rather than read — and the rules for what

 *
 * ⛔ **Almost everything that used to live here has gone, and each departure is a fact about the
 * data rather than a tidy-up.** `similarityFromDistance` converted a stored cosine DISTANCE into a
 * similarity; the API now serves similarities everywhere it once served distances — on the locus
 * card and on the footer's residual rows alike — so a surviving `1 − d` would silently print the
 * complement of a real number. `cohesion` rescaled a member's distance to ONE gene (its medoid)
 * against the random-pair baseline and captioned the result "cohesion"; the label and the number
 * have now moved together, and the within-cluster median over every gene pair is shown directly, in
 * the same units the card below it shows. `separationVerdict` banded exactly one of what are now
 * three views, so it lives with the view table in `lib/similarityViews`.
 *
 * ⛔ Three numbers were re-derived on the published page and must not be re-derived here either:
 * every percentile is a precomputed midrank over measurable loci, the Pfam verdict is the audit's
 * own (`pfam.concordance_class`), and the display name and best product are ingest columns.
