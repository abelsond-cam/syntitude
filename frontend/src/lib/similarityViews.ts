/**

 * ⭐ **Three views, and they REPLACE each other rather than stacking** (David, 2026-09-24: *"a click
 * box option for median (default to show) and then to look at the weak scores and the own fraction
 * as secondary options … when you click on other options, they replace the median view"*). They are
 * not three pictures of one thing, which is why all three are stored: flagging by each — worst
 * decile of separation, negative weak margin, own fraction below 1 — only **34 %** (ecoli/Bacformer)
 * and **18 %** (ESM) of flagged loci are flagged by all three, and of the median's worst decile only
 * 50 % / 22 % have a negative margin. Rank ρ 0.79–0.93: they agree overall and part at the tail,
 * which is exactly where flagging happens.
 *
 * ⛔ **The difference is subtracted HERE and is deliberately not served.** `separation` and `margin`
 * are each the difference of two fields the response carries, and a separately-rounded difference
 * drifting from the two rounded numbers printed beside it is the exact class of quiet disagreement
 * this card was rebuilt to end.
