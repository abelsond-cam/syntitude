/**
 * The fan under the focal gene — one curve from the gene down to each arrangement it offers.
 *
 * ⭐ **Pure arithmetic over rectangles**, like `popoverPlacement`: jsdom computes no layout, so the
 * caller measures and this decides. `app.js::drawArrFan` is the reference, number for number.
 *
 * ⚠ **The gene moves under a panel that does not.** The track scrolls sideways; the switcher below it
 * does not. So the fan is recomputed from LIVE rectangles on every scroll and resize, and when the
 * focal gene has scrolled out of the scroller the fan draws nothing at all — a line that points at
 * nothing is worse than no line.
