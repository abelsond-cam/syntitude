/**
 * Which species the page is showing, and everything about it that arrives before a locus.
 *
 * ⭐ **A species switch is a navigation, not a filter** (`app.js`, the species picker). One page holds
 * one catalogue: the loci, the anchor genomes and every cache key belong to it, and nothing carries
 * across. So choosing a species resets the navigation store rather than re-filtering it.
 *
 * ⚠ **Three loading states here too, never conflated** — the same rule as the locus view. A species
 * list that failed to load and a deployment with no published species are different claims, and the
 * picker must not make the same face at both.
