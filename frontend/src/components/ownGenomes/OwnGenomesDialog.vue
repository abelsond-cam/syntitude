 * A100, bf16, the pinned ESM-C + Bacformer path over three probe genomes: **median 14.3 s per
 * genome**, of which Bacformer is 0.12–0.47 s and ESM-C is all the rest. Rounded to 15 on purpose:
 * the three spanned 13–23 s (the first pays CUDA warm-up), so a decimal would claim a precision the
 * measurement does not have. ⚠ It is the HuggingFace attention path — the run warns faESM is not
 * installed — so a tuned service is faster than what is quoted here, never slower.
 *
 * ⭐ **And so is the CPU figure** — CSD3 job 36055321, 32 Icelake cores, **fp32 because an Icelake
 * core has no native bf16 matmul**: 527.7 s and 372.2 s for the same two genomes, so ~7.5 min,
 * quoted as 8. ⚠ **The core count is part of the number and is said on screen**: this is a 32-core
 * server, and a 4-core laptop is roughly eight times slower again. (The laptop measurement was
 * abandoned — MPS ran out of memory at 13 GiB on a 16 GB machine — and is not missed: 32 cores is
 * what a CPU deployment would have.) Both numbers and their jobs: nuna's `PROJECT_STATE.md` §6.
