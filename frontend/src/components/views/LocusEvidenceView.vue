 * "Syntelog Loci" — the home view: what this locus is, and the evidence for it being one.

 * Two columns, as the published card drew them (`app.js::renderCard`): the ARGUMENT on the left —
 * the headline and the sequence-diversity card — and the REFERENCE column beside it.
 *
 * ⛔ That column held two cards until 2026-09-24: the embedding geometry, and a neighbourhood map
 * immediately below the numbers it was a picture of. Both went together, because they were ONE
 * construction — the map was an MDS of six loci's MEDOIDS and each ring was that locus's members'
 * median distance to its own medoid, so a set-to-set similarity has nothing for it to draw. The five
 * nearest loci survive: they are now ranked by a median over gene pairs and are listed on the
 * similarity card itself, beside the row they are the evidence for.
