/**
 * **COG** — the orthologous groups these genes were assigned, and how many of them there are.
 *
 * ⭐ **Partial COG coverage is HEADROOM, not a caveat (David, 2026-08-20).** COG is assigned by best
 * hit rather than by a profile HMM, so a gene without one is *unlabelled*, not *different*. That is
 * far weaker evidence of absence than a Pfam miss, which really is a profile failing to match — and
 * the card says so, because the alternative reads as a hole in the locus when it is a hole in the
 * annotation.
 *
 * ⛔ **It states that the opportunity exists; it does NOT predict.** Propagating a COG from the
 * annotated members to the rest is *annotation transfer*, which is a method to be chosen
 * deliberately: it needs a transfer rule, a confidence measure, a decision about discordant loci and
 * a marking that can never be mistaken for a Bakta call. None of that is shipped, so neither is a
 * predicted label.
 *
 * ⛔ **The distinct-id count is a COUNT, never a relation.** More than one orthologous group in a
 * locus is an ordinary consequence of grouping above the family level, which is what this method
 * does — it is read beside the sequence and context evidence, not as a fault.
