/**
 * **Embedding Similarity — consistency, never corroboration.**
 *
 * ⛔ Embedding distance is *the clustering's own objective*, so this card is reported as consistency
 * and diagnosis and must never be read as independent support. The independent evidence is above:
 * UniRef50, Pfam and genomic context. The published card says so in its own footer and that sentence
 * is carried here verbatim.
 *
 * ⛔ **This replaced the medoid `Embedding geometry` card, and the measurement changed with it.**
 * The old card reduced a locus to ONE member — the gene nearest its centroid — and measured that
 * point. Every number here is a median over whole gene SETS, or is anchored on the single member
 * least attached to its locus. The old construction was biased optimistic: the all-pairs median sits
 * 0.009–0.017 below the medoid one, and separation < 0 was understated at 2.5 % against a true 4.2 %.
 *
 * ⭐ **Three views, and they REPLACE each other rather than stacking** (David, 2026-09-24). The
 * choice is the reader's and survives a walk, so it lives in `similarityViewStore` rather than being
 * rebuilt from the locus — and never in the URL.
 *
 * ⚠ **Both representations are STACKED inside whichever view is showing — they are not tabs.** The
 * two disagree about WHICH loci are weak (of the 1,059 ecoli loci Bacformer flags, ESM rescues 817),
 * and a tab would hide exactly that disagreement behind a click.
 *
 * ⚠ **Not measurable is a sentence, not a zero.** A singleton has no pair inside its locus at all —
 * 5,427 of *E. coli*'s 17,531 loci — and rendering that as `0.000` puts a made-up number beside real
 * ones.
