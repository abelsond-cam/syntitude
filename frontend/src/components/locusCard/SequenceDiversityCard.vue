 * **Sequence diversity and Bakta annotations — ONE card, deliberately.**
 *
 * ⭐ They were two, and the second largely restated the first: UniRef50 is the sequence fact and the
 * Bakta name is *derived from it*, so a locus's families and its names are one table, not two lists
 * in two boxes. That separation is what hid `ybeF` (David, 2026-08-19) — its families split 63/33
 * and its symbols 63/35, in different cards, and the correspondence between them had to be guessed.
 * The join ships, so a row is a statement about its own genes.
 *
 * The Pfam verdict rides here for the same reason: it is a verdict about *these families*, and it
 * had a whole card whose visible content was the accession chips this table already carries.
 *
 * ⛔ **Both verdicts are READ, never re-derived.** `app.js:3208` — the page once re-derived the Pfam
 * class by a different rule and disagreed with the audit on 2 of 22,624 loci. *"A page that quotes
 * the report must not be able to contradict it, ever."*
